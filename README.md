# Traffic Light Simulation 🚦

This project simulates a simple traffic light system using an **Arduino UNO** and three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green). The lights turn ON one after another with a fixed delay, just like a real-world traffic signal. The project is programmed using **Arduino IDE** 🖥️.

## Components 🛠️
- Arduino UNO
- Red LED
- Yellow LED
- Green LED
- Resistors (220Ω recommended)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Features 🌟
- Red, Yellow, and Green lights glow one after another.  
- Each light stays ON for **5 seconds** before switching.  
- Simple and beginner-friendly project for understanding Arduino basics.  

## How It Works ▶️
1. **Red light** turns ON for 5 seconds, others remain OFF.  
2. **Yellow light** turns ON for 5 seconds, others remain OFF.  
3. **Green light** turns ON for 5 seconds, others remain OFF.  
4. The cycle repeats continuously, simulating a traffic signal.  

## Project Image 🖼️
A **complete image of all the glowing LEDs (Red, Yellow/Orange, Green)** has been attached in this repository.  

## Notes 📝
- The project is coded and uploaded using **Arduino IDE**.  
- You can adjust the `delay()` values to change how long each light stays ON.  
- For a more realistic traffic system, timings can be modified (e.g., longer red, shorter yellow).
